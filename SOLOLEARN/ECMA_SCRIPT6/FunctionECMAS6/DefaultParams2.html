And here's an example of an arrow function with default parameters:
-->

<html>
    <body>
    </body>
        <script>
            const test = (a,b = 3, c = 42) => {
                return a + b + c;
            }
            console.log(test(5)); //50
        </script>
</html>

<!--  
Default value expressions are evaluated at function call time from left to right. This also means that default expressions can use the values of previously-filled parameters.
